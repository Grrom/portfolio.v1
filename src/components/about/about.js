                I'm a <strong>Web and App Developer</strong> from the Philippines, 
                I like coding and contributing to <strong>OpenSource</strong> community projects.
                I'm open for <strong>Internships, Freelance or OpenSource projects</strong> related to <strong>App Development or Web Development. </strong>
                I'm still in college so I don't have a lot of work experience but 
                I do have several <strong>Tech Internships, Freelance</strong> experience and <strong>OpenSource</strong> contributions.
